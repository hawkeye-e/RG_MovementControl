# RG_MovementControl

A simple tool to force the characters to stay on their existing positions.
It cancels all the character movement unless it is a player's command.

This tool should only be used for setting up a favourite situation and should not be turned on all the time as 
1. characters cannot go to sleep automatically
2. characters cannot go to toilet automatically
3. characters may stop chatting and unable to return to original position automatically
